========
52.1 LTS
========

The Avocado team is proud to present another release: Avocado version
52.1, a minor release in the second Avocado LTS major version.

What's new?
===========

When compared to the previous minor release, there was a single bufxix
introduced here:

* Avocado won't crash when attempting, and not succeeding, to create a
  user-level configuration file ``~/.config/avocado.conf``.  This is
  useful in restricted environments such as in containers, where the
  user may not have its own home directory.  Avocado also won't crash,
  but will report failure and exit, when it's not able to create the
  job results directory.

this release, please check out `the Avocado commit changelog
